Popular music has always provided the score for daily life. There is music to cover falling in love, heartbreak and every other emotion in between. Music has also always been a vehicle for social commentary.

Ghana's musical reputation was built on Highlife, a melodic genre of music that began to spread across west Africa in the 1930s and provided commentary on the age. Today the culture persists even though the sound has changed.
